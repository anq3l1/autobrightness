# AutoBrightness

This is a simple program for changing the brightness due to the lighting in the room, like the auto-brightness function on Android, it uses the camera application, but I don’t know how to turn off the ice indicator, anyone who wants can finish the software, I left the source code

# What does this program involve?

This program changes the brightness depending on the lighting in your room or location, in other words, auto-brightness, the program uses the camera using the OpenCV library, the program is not fully completed yet, but is ready for use, the idea seems quite interesting to me, I’ll try to add something or do more.
